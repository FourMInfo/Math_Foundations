# FourM Study Guides & Documentation Sites

This site is one of several documentation sites for my personal math and technology study under what I call the FourM project. It is essentially a collection of resources I created to understand various mathematical concepts and software frameworks.

The main sites can be found at:

- [Main Study Site](https://study.fourm.info/)
- [FourM GitHub Repository](https://github.com/fourm)

Here are some of the key documentation sites related to my mathematics study:

- [Linear Algebra Docs](https://study.fourm.info/linear_algebra/)
- [Math Foundations Docs - the current site (this site)](https://study.fourm.info/math_foundations/)
