# Solving Equations

[Equations](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Equation.html) are mathematical statements that assert the equality of two expressions. Solving equations means finding the values of variables that make the equation true. The solutions of an equation are the values of the variable that satisfy the equation, making both sides equal. For polynomial equations (where $P(x) = 0$), these solutions are also called **roots** or **zeros**. These are discussed in the separate document [Finding Polynomial Roots and Zeros](./04 Finding Polynomial Roots and Zeros.md). In this document we will discuss (mostly) algebraic methods for solving equations of various types.

## Linear Equations

[Linear equations](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/LinearEquation.html) are equations of the first degree, meaning the highest power of the variable is 1.

### Standard Forms

- **One variable:** $ax + b = 0$
- **Two variables:** $ax + by = c$
- **Slope-intercept form:** $y = mx + b$

### Solving Linear Equations

1. **Isolate the variable** by performing the same operations on both sides
2. **Combine like terms**
3. **Use inverse operations** (addition/subtraction, multiplication/division)

### Example Solution Process

**Example 1:** Solve $2(x - 3) + 4 = 3(1 - x)$

1. Expand: $2x - 6 + 4 = 3 - 3x$
2. Simplify: $2x - 2 = 3 - 3x$
3. Add $3x$ to both sides: $5x - 2 = 3$
4. Add 2 to both sides: $5x = 5$
5. Divide by 5: $x = 1$

**Example 2 (Combining Like Terms):** Solve $3x + 7 - x + 2 = 5x - 4 + 2x$

1. Combine like terms on left side: $(3x - x) + (7 + 2) = 2x + 9$
2. Combine like terms on right side: $(5x + 2x) - 4 = 7x - 4$
3. Rewrite equation: $2x + 9 = 7x - 4$
4. Subtract $2x$ from both sides: $9 = 5x - 4$
5. Add 4 to both sides: $13 = 5x$
6. Divide by 5: $x = \frac{13}{5}$

## Quadratic Equations

[Quadratic equations](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/QuadraticEquation.html) are second-degree polynomial equations of the form:
$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$
where $a \neq 0$.

### Methods for Solving Quadratic Equations

#### 1. Factoring

If the quadratic can be [factored](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Factorization.html) as $(px + q)(rx + s) = 0$, then:

- either factor may equal 0: $px + q = 0$ or $rx + s = 0$
- solve for x: $x = -\frac{q}{p}$ or $x = -\frac{s}{r}$

**Example:** Solve $x^2 + 7x + 12 = 0$

1. Find two numbers that multiply to $12$ and add to $7$: $3$ and $4$
2. Factor: $(x + 3)(x + 4) = 0$
3. Set each factor to zero: $x + 3 = 0$ or $x + 4 = 0$
4. Solve: $x = -3$ or $x = -4$

**Note:** Not all quadratics can be factored easily over the integers. For example, $x^2 + x - 1 = 0$ requires the quadratic formula.

#### 2. Completing the Square

[Completing the square](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CompletingtheSquare.html) is a method that rewrites the quadratic in a form that makes it easy to solve and is related to the quadratic formula (see below). The idea is to transform $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ into $(x + d)^2 = e$ form and then use the square root property to find the roots.

**Example:** Solve $x^2 + 6x + 5 = 0$ by completing the square

1. Move constant: $x^2 + 6x = -5$
2. Add $\left(\frac{6}{2}\right)^2 = 9$ to both sides: $x^2 + 6x + 9 = -5 + 9 = 4$
3. Factor: $(x + 3)^2 = 4$
4. Take square root: $x + 3 = \pm 2$
5. Solve: $x = -3 \pm 2$, so $x = -1$ or $x = -5$

**Key difference:**

- **Completing the square:** Transform the equation step-by-step into perfect square form
- **Quadratic formula:** Apply the pre-derived formula directly

Both give the same answer, but completing the square shows the geometric/algebraic structure more clearly.

#### 3. Quadratic Formula

The [quadratic formula](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/QuadraticFormula.html) is a general solution for any quadratic equation:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

**Using completing the square to derive the quadratic formula:**

Starting with the general quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ where $a \neq 0$:

1. **Divide by $a$** (if $a \neq 1$): $x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a} = 0$
2. **Move constant to right side:** $x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x = -\frac{c}{a}$
3. **Take half of the coefficient of $x$ and square it:** $\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2$
4. **Add this value to both sides:** $x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = -\frac{c}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2$
5. **Factor the left side as a perfect square:** $\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 = -\frac{c}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2$
6. **Take the square root of both sides:** $x + \frac{b}{2a} = \pm\sqrt{-\frac{c}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2}$
7. **Solve for $x$:** $x = -\frac{b}{2a} \pm \sqrt{-\frac{c}{a} + \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2}$

**Example:** Solve $2x^2 + 5x - 3 = 0$

Here: $a = 2$, $b = 5$, $c = -3$

$$\begin{aligned}
x &= \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{5^2 - 4(2)(-3)}}{2(2)} \\
&= \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 24}}{4} \\
&= \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{49}}{4} \\
&= \frac{-5 \pm 7}{4}
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore: $x = \frac{-5 + 7}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$ or $x = \frac{-5 - 7}{4} = -3$

**The Discriminant:**

The [discriminant](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Discriminant.html) $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$ determines the nature of solutions:

- Two distinct real s: $\Delta > 0$
- One repeated real solution: $\Delta = 0$
- Two complex conjugate solutions: $\Delta < 0$

**Note on Complex Conjugates:** Complex conjugates are pairs of complex numbers of the form $a + bi$ and $a - bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i = \sqrt{-1}$. They have the same real part but opposite imaginary parts.

**Examples by Type:**

- **Two real roots:** $x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0$
  - Discriminant: $\Delta = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(6) = 25 - 24 = 1 > 0$
  - Solutions: $x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{1}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm 1}{2}$, so $x = 3$ or $x = 2$

- **One real root:** $x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0$
  - Discriminant: $\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(4) = 16 - 16 = 0$
  - Solution: $x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{0}}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2$ (double root)

- **Complex conjugate roots:** $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$
  - Discriminant: $\Delta = (1)^2 - 4(1)(1) = 1 - 4 = -3 < 0$
  - Solutions: $x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}$
  - Complex conjugates: $\frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}$

#### 4. Graphical Method

Find x-intercepts of the parabola $y = ax^2 + bx + c$.

**Steps for Graphical Solution:**

1. **Plot the parabola** $y = ax^2 + bx + c$
2. **Find x-intercepts** (where the graph crosses the x-axis, i.e., where $y = 0$)
3. **Read the x-coordinates** of intersection points

**Advantages:**

- Provides visual understanding of the solution
- Shows the number of real solutions immediately
- Useful for approximate solutions

**Limitations:**

- May not give exact solutions
- Requires graphing tools or software for accuracy

**Example:** For $y = x^2 - 3x + 2$, the parabola intersects the x-axis at $x = 1$ and $x = 2$.

## Higher Degree Equations

For equations of degree 3 and higher, various specialized techniques may be needed:

### Cubic Equations

[Cubic equations](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CubicEquation.html) have the form $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0$ where $a \neq 0$.

#### Methods for Solving Cubic Equations

##### 1. Factoring by Grouping

**Example:** Solve $x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 2 = 0$

1. Group terms: $(x^3 + 2x^2) + (-x - 2) = 0$
2. Factor each group: $x^2(x + 2) - 1(x + 2) = 0$
3. Factor out common factor: $(x^2 - 1)(x + 2) = 0$
4. Factor further: $(x - 1)(x + 1)(x + 2) = 0$
5. Solutions: $x = 1, -1, -2$

##### 2. Rational Root Theorem

See [04 Finding Polynomial Roots and Zeros](04 Finding Polynomial Roots and Zeros.md) for details on the Rational Root Theorem and its relationship to synthetic division.

**Example:** Find rational roots of $2x^3 - 3x^2 - 11x + 6 = 0$

1. Possible rational roots: $\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6, \pm \frac{1}{2}, \pm \frac{3}{2}$
2. Testing $x = 3$: $2(27) - 3(9) - 11(3) + 6 = 54 - 27 - 33 + 6 = 0$ âœ“
3. So $(x - 3)$ is a factor.
4. Using synthetic division: $2x^3 - 3x^2 - 11x + 6 = (x - 3)(2x^2 + 3x - 2)$
5. Factor the quadratic: $2x^2 + 3x - 2 = (2x - 1)(x + 2)$
6. Complete factorization: $(x - 3)(2x - 1)(x + 2) = 0$

Solutions: $x = 3, \frac{1}{2}, -2$

##### 3. Cardano's Formula

For the general cubic $ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0$, there exists an exact formula (Cardano's formula), but it's complex and rarely used in practice for numerical solutions.

### Biquadratic Equations

[Biquadratic equations](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/BiquadraticEquation.html) are fourth-degree equations of the form:
$$ax^4 + bx^2 + c = 0$$

#### Solution Method

1. **Substitute** $u = x^2$ to get $au^2 + bu + c = 0$
2. **Solve the quadratic** in $u$ using standard methods
3. **Back-substitute** to find $x$ values from $x^2 = u$

#### Example

Solve: $x^4 - 5x^2 + 4 = 0$

1. Let $u = x^2$: $u^2 - 5u + 4 = 0$
2. Factor: $(u - 1)(u - 4) = 0$
3. Solutions: $u = 1$ or $u = 4$
4. Back-substitute: $x^2 = 1$ or $x^2 = 4$
5. Final solutions: $x = \pm 1, \pm 2$

## Logarithmic and Exponential Equations

These equations involve [exponential functions](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ExponentialFunction.html) or [logarithmic](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Logarithm.html) expressions and require special techniques.

### Exponential Equations

Equations where the variable appears in an exponent.

#### Simple Exponential Equations

For equations like $a^x = b$:

1. Take logarithm of both sides: $\log(a^x) = \log(b)$
2. Use logarithm properties: $x \log(a) = \log(b)$
3. Solve: $x = \frac{\log(b)}{\log(a)}$

**Example 1:** Solve $2^x = 32$

Since $32 = 2^5$, we have $2^x = 2^5$, so $x = 5$.

**Example 2:** Solve $3^x = 50$

$$x = \frac{\log(50)}{\log(3)} = \frac{\ln(50)}{\ln(3)} \approx \frac{3.912}{1.099} \approx 3.56$$

#### More Complex Exponential Equations

**Example:** Solve $2^{x+1} + 2^x = 12$

1. Factor out $2^x$: $2^x \cdot 2^1 + 2^x = 12$
2. Simplify: $2 \cdot 2^x + 2^x = 12$
3. Factor: $2^x(2 + 1) = 12$
4. Solve: $3 \cdot 2^x = 12 \Rightarrow 2^x = 4 = 2^2$
5. Therefore: $x = 2$

### Logarithmic Equations

Equations involving logarithmic expressions.

#### Basic Logarithmic Equations

**Example 1:** Solve $\log_2(x) = 5$

Convert to exponential form: $x = 2^5 = 32$

**Example 2:** Solve $\log(x) + \log(x - 3) = 1$ (common logarithm, base 10)

1. Use logarithm properties: $\log(x(x - 3)) = 1$
2. Convert to exponential form: $x(x - 3) = 10^1 = 10$
3. Expand: $x^2 - 3x = 10$
4. Rearrange: $x^2 - 3x - 10 = 0$
5. Factor: $(x - 5)(x + 2) = 0$
6. Potential solutions: $x = 5$ or $x = -2$
7. Check domain: $x > 0$ and $x - 3 > 0$, so $x > 3$
8. Valid solution: $x = 5$ (reject $x = -2$)

#### Equations with Multiple Logarithms

**Example:** Solve $\log_3(x + 1) - \log_3(x - 1) = 1$

1. Use quotient rule: $\log_3\left(\frac{x + 1}{x - 1}\right) = 1$
2. Convert to exponential form: $\frac{x + 1}{x - 1} = 3^1 = 3$
3. Cross multiply: $x + 1 = 3(x - 1)$
4. Expand: $x + 1 = 3x - 3$
5. Solve: $1 + 3 = 3x - x \Rightarrow 4 = 2x \Rightarrow x = 2$
6. Check domain: $x + 1 > 0$ and $x - 1 > 0$, so $x > 1$ âœ“

### Mixed Exponential-Logarithmic Equations

**Example:** Solve $e^x - \ln(x) = 2$

This type of equation typically requires numerical methods or graphical solutions, as there's no algebraic method to isolate $x$.

## Verification and Domain Considerations

Always verify solutions by substituting back into the original equation. Pay attention to:

- **[Domain](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Domain.html) restrictions** (e.g., denominators â‰  0, arguments of logarithms > 0)
- **Extraneous solutions** introduced by algebraic manipulations
- **Practical constraints** in applied problems
