# Numbers and Elementary Calculations

This section covers the fundamental mathematical operations and calculations that form the foundation of mathematical study.

## Numbers and Number Systems

Numbers are the basic building blocks of mathematics.

### Basic Types of Numbers

Numbers can be categorized into different types based on their properties, forming a hierarchical structure:

- **Natural Numbers (ℕ)** - Positive integers starting from 1: {1, 2, 3, 4, ...}
- **Whole Numbers (ℕ₀)** - Natural numbers including zero: {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
- **Integers (ℤ)** - Whole numbers including negatives: {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
- **Rational Numbers (ℚ)** - Numbers expressible as fractions: {p/q where p, q ∈ ℤ, q ≠ 0}
- **Irrational Numbers** - Numbers that cannot be expressed as fractions: {√2, π, e, ...}
- **Real Numbers (ℝ)** - All rational and irrational numbers combined
- **Imaginary Numbers** - Multiples of the imaginary unit i: {bi where b ∈ ℝ, i² = -1}
- **Complex Numbers (ℂ)** - Numbers with real and imaginary parts: {a + bi where a, b ∈ ℝ}

### Extended Types of Numbers

In addition to the basic types, there are several extended types of numbers used in advanced mathematics:

- **Algebraic Numbers** - Roots of polynomial equations with integer coefficients (e.g., √2, which is a root of x² - 2 = 0)
- **Transcendental Numbers** - Irrational numbers that are not algebraic (e.g., e, π)
- **Ordinal Numbers** - Numbers indicating position in a sequence (e.g., first, second, third)
- **Cardinal Numbers** - Numbers indicating quantity (e.g., one, two, three)
- **Transfinite Numbers** - Numbers extending beyond finite quantities, used in set theory (e.g., ℵ₀, cardinality of natural numbers)
- **Hyperreal Numbers** - Extension of reals including infinitesimals and infinite numbers, used in non-standard analysis
- **Surreal Numbers** - Class including reals, infinitesimals, and infinite numbers, used in game theory
- **P-adic Numbers** - Number system based on divisibility by prime p, used in number theory
- **Quaternions** - Four-dimensional extension of complex numbers: a + bi + cj + dk
- **Hypercomplex Numbers** - Generalizations of complex numbers including quaternions and octonions
- **Dual Numbers** - Extension of reals with infinitesimal unit ε where ε² = 0

### Important Number Categories

- **Even Numbers** - Integers divisible by 2 (e.g., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ...)
- **Odd Numbers** - Integers not divisible by 2 (e.g., -3, -1, 1, 3, 5, ...)
- **Prime Numbers** - Natural numbers greater than 1 with no divisors other than 1 and themselves (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...)
- **Composite Numbers** - Natural numbers greater than 1 that are not prime (e.g., 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, ...)
- **Perfect Numbers** - Positive integers equal to the sum of their proper divisors (e.g., 6, 28, 496)
- 

## Arithmetic Operations

Basic arithmetic operations form the foundation of mathematical computation and follow specific rules and properties.

### Fundamental Operations

The four basic arithmetic operations:

- **Addition (+)** - Combining quantities
- **Subtraction (-)** - Finding the difference between quantities  
- **Multiplication (× or ·)** - Repeated addition
- **Division (÷ or /)** - Repeated subtraction or inverse of multiplication

### Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)

Operations must be performed in the correct sequence:

1. **Parentheses/Brackets** - Operations inside grouping symbols first
1. **Exponents/Orders** - Powers and roots second
1. **Multiplication and Division** - From left to right, third
1. **Addition and Subtraction** - From left to right, last

The BODMAS acronym is used in some regions, where "B" stands for Brackets and "O" for Orders (exponents).

### Key Properties of Arithmetic Operations

Essential properties that govern arithmetic operations:

- **Commutative Property**
  - Addition: a + b = b + a
  - Multiplication: a × b = b × a
  - Note: Subtraction and division are NOT commutative

- **Associative Property**
  - Addition: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
  - Multiplication: (a × b) × c = a × (b × c)
  - Note: Subtraction and division are NOT associative

- **Distributive Property** - a(b + c) = ab + ac allows distributing multiplication over addition

- **Identity Elements**
  - Additive identity: a + 0 = a
  - Multiplicative identity: a × 1 = a

- **Inverse Elements**
  - Additive inverse: a + (-a) = 0
  - Multiplicative inverse: a × (1/a) = 1 (for a ≠ 0)

- **Special Properties**
  - Zero property of multiplication: a × 0 = 0
  - Division by zero is undefined
  - Absolute value: |a| represents distance from zero

### Working with Signed Numbers

Rules for operations with positive and negative numbers:

- **Addition**
  - Same signs: Add absolute values, keep the sign
    - Example: (-3) + (-5) = -(3 + 5) = -8
    - Example: 7 + 4 = 11
  - Different signs: Subtract smaller absolute value from larger, use sign of larger
    - Example: (-7) + 3 = -(7 - 3) = -4
    - Example: 8 + (-5) = 8 - 5 = 3

- **Subtraction**
  - a - b = a + (-b) (subtracting equals adding the opposite)
    - Example: 5 - 8 = 5 + (-8) = -3
    - Example: (-4) - (-7) = (-4) + 7 = 3

- **Multiplication and Division**
  - Same signs: Result is positive
    - Example: (-6) × (-4) = 24
    - Example: 15 ÷ 3 = 5
  - Different signs: Result is negative
    - Example: (-8) × 3 = -24
    - Example: 20 ÷ (-4) = -5

## Fractions

Fractions represent parts of a whole and are fundamental to understanding rational numbers.

### Basic Fraction Concepts

Essential terminology and notation:

- **Fraction Form** - Written as a/b where a is the _numerator_ and b is the _denominator_ (b ≠ 0)
- **Proper Fraction** - Numerator less than denominator (e.g., 3/4)
- **Improper Fraction** - Numerator greater than or equal to denominator (e.g., 5/3)
- **Mixed Number** - Whole number plus proper fraction (e.g., 1⅔ = 5/3)
- **Unit Fraction** - Numerator equals 1 (e.g., 1/2, 1/3, 1/5)

### Equivalent Fractions

Fractions representing the same value:

- **Fundamental Principle** - Multiplying or dividing both numerator and denominator by the same non-zero number gives an equivalent fraction
- **Examples** - 1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6 = 4/8 = ...
- **Cross-Multiplication Test** - a/b = c/d if and only if ad = bc

### Operations with Fractions

Systematic methods for operating with fractions:

- **Addition and Subtraction**
  - Same denominator: Add/subtract numerators, keep denominator
    - Example: 3/7 + 2/7 = (3+2)/7 = 5/7
    - Example: 5/8 - 1/8 = (5-1)/8 = 4/8 = 1/2
  - Different denominators: Find common denominator first
    - Example: 1/4 + 1/6 = 3/12 + 2/12 = 5/12
    - Example: 3/5 - 1/3 = 9/15 - 5/15 = 4/15
  - General form: a/b ± c/d = (ad ± bc)/(bd)

- **Multiplication**
  - Multiply numerators and denominators: (a/b) × (c/d) = (ac)/(bd)
    - Example: 2/3 × 4/5 = (2×4)/(3×5) = 8/15
    - Example: 3/4 × 2/9 = 6/36 = 1/6 (after simplification)
  - Simplify by canceling common factors before multiplying
    - Example: 4/9 × 3/8 = (4×3)/(9×8) = 1/6 (canceling 4 and 8, then 3 and 9)

- **Division**
  - Multiply by reciprocal: (a/b) ÷ (c/d) = (a/b) × (d/c) = (ad)/(bc)
    - Example: 2/3 ÷ 4/5 = 2/3 × 5/4 = 10/12 = 5/6
    - Example: 7/8 ÷ 3/4 = 7/8 × 4/3 = 28/24 = 7/6
  - Remember: "invert and multiply"

### Fraction Simplification

Reducing fractions to lowest terms using systematic methods:

- **Find the GCD** - Greatest common divisor of numerator and denominator
  - Example: For 12/18, GCD(12,18) = 6, so 12/18 = (12÷6)/(18÷6) = 2/3

- **Prime factorization method** - Factor both parts and cancel common prime factors
  - Example: 24/36 = (2³×3)/(2²×3²) = (2×3)/(3²) = 6/9 = 2/3

- **Visual method** - Look for obvious common factors (2, 3, 5, etc.)
  - Example: 15/25 = (3×5)/(5×5) = 3/5

- **Euclidean algorithm** - Systematic method for finding GCD
  - For GCD(48,18): 48 = 18×2 + 12, then 18 = 12×1 + 6, then 12 = 6×2 + 0, so GCD = 6

### Comparing Fractions

Methods for determining which fraction is larger:

- **Cross-multiplication** - To compare a/b and c/d, compare ad with bc
  - Example: Compare 2/3 and 3/5: 2×5 = 10, 3×3 = 9, so 2/3 > 3/5

- **Common denominator** - Convert to same denominator and compare numerators
  - Example: 2/3 vs 3/5 becomes 10/15 vs 9/15, so 2/3 > 3/5

- **Decimal conversion** - Convert to decimals for easy comparison
  - Example: 2/3 ≈ 0.667, 3/5 = 0.6, so 2/3 > 3/5

## Powers and Exponents

Powers and exponents provide a compact way to represent repeated multiplication and form the basis for more advanced mathematical concepts.

### Basic Exponent Notation

Understanding the components and meaning:

- **Base** - The number being multiplied repeatedly
- **Exponent** - How many times the base multiplies itself
- **Power** - The result of the exponentiation
- **Exponential Form** - aⁿ where a is base, n is exponent

### Fundamental Exponent Laws

These rules apply to all real number bases (with appropriate restrictions):

- **Product Rule** - aᵐ × aⁿ = aᵐ⁺ⁿ
  - Example: 2³ × 2⁴ = 2³⁺⁴ = 2⁷ = 128
  - Example: x⁵ × x² = x⁷

- **Quotient Rule** - aᵐ ÷ aⁿ = aᵐ⁻ⁿ (a ≠ 0)
  - Example: 3⁶ ÷ 3² = 3⁶⁻² = 3⁴ = 81
  - Example: y⁸ ÷ y³ = y⁵

- **Power Rule** - (aᵐ)ⁿ = aᵐⁿ
  - Example: (2³)² = 2³ˣ² = 2⁶ = 64
  - Example: (x⁴)³ = x¹²

- **Product to Power** - (ab)ⁿ = aⁿbⁿ
  - Example: (3×4)² = 3² × 4² = 9 × 16 = 144
  - Example: (xy)³ = x³y³

- **Quotient to Power** - (a/b)ⁿ = aⁿ/bⁿ (b ≠ 0)
  - Example: (2/3)³ = 2³/3³ = 8/27
  - Example: (x/y)⁴ = x⁴/y⁴

### Special Exponent Cases

Important special values and their meanings:

- **Zero Exponent** - a⁰ = 1 (for a ≠ 0)
- **Unit Exponent** - a¹ = a
- **Negative Exponents** - a⁻ⁿ = 1/aⁿ (a ≠ 0)
- **Fractional Exponents** - a^(m/n) = ⁿ√(aᵐ) = (ⁿ√a)ᵐ

### Sign Rules for Exponents

How signs behave with different exponent types:

- **Even Exponents** - Always produce non-negative results: a²ⁿ ≥ 0
- **Odd Exponents** - Preserve the sign of the base
- **Negative Bases** - Use parentheses to clarify: (-2)³ = -8 vs -2³ = -8

### Simplification Strategies

Systematic approach to simplifying exponential expressions:

1. **Identify like bases** - Group terms with the same base
1. **Apply exponent laws** - Use product, quotient, and power rules
1. **Simplify fractions** - Reduce coefficients and apply quotient rule
1. **Handle negative exponents** - Convert to positive using reciprocals
1. **Evaluate numerical powers** - Calculate simple powers directly
1. **Convert between forms** - Use radical notation when helpful

## Roots and Radicals

Roots are the inverse operations of powers and are essential for solving equations and simplifying expressions.

### Basic Root Concepts

Fundamental terminology and notation:

- **Root Definition** - If rⁿ = x, then r is an nth root of x
- **Radical Notation** - ⁿ√x represents the nth root of x
- **Radicand** - The expression under the radical sign
- **Index** - The small number indicating which root (2 for square root, 3 for cube root, etc.)
- **Principal Root** - The non-negative root (for even indices of positive numbers)

### Types of Roots

Different roots have different properties:

- **Square Roots (√)** - Most common; every positive number has two square roots (±)
- **Cube Roots (∛)** - Every real number has exactly one real cube root
- **Even Roots** - Require non-negative radicands for real results
- **Odd Roots** - Defined for all real numbers, preserve sign of radicand

### Radical Properties

Rules governing radical operations:

- **Product Property** - ⁿ√(ab) = ⁿ√a × ⁿ√b
- **Quotient Property** - ⁿ√(a/b) = ⁿ√a / ⁿ√b (b ≠ 0)
- **Power Property** - ⁿ√(aᵐ) = a^(m/n)
- **Root of Root** - ᵐ√(ⁿ√a) = ᵐⁿ√a

### Simplifying Radicals

Systematic approach to radical simplification:

#### Step 1: Factor out perfect powers

- √18 = √(9 × 2) = 3√2
- √48 = √(16 × 3) = 4√3
- ∛24 = ∛(8 × 3) = 2∛3

#### Step 2: Combine like radicals

- 3√2 + 2√2 = 5√2
- 4√3 - 7√3 = -3√3
- 2√5 + 3√2 (cannot be simplified further)

#### Step 3: Simplify complex expressions

Example: 2√12 + 3√27

- Simplify each: 2√12 = 2(2√3) = 4√3 and 3√27 = 3(3√3) = 9√3
- Combine: 4√3 + 9√3 = 13√3

#### Step 4: Rationalize denominators

- Simple: 1/√2 × √2/√2 = √2/2
- Complex: 1/(2 + √3) × (2 - √3)/(2 - √3) = (2 - √3)/(4 - 3) = 2 - √3

#### Step 5: Use radical identities

- Multiplication: √6 × √10 = √60 = √(4 × 15) = 2√15
- Division: √20 ÷ √5 = √(20/5) = √4 = 2

### Special Cases of Roots

Important root behaviors:

- **Even roots of positive numbers** - Two real solutions (±)
- **Even roots of negative numbers** - Complex solutions
- **Odd roots** - One real solution for any real number
- **Principal roots** - Non-negative by convention

## Algebraic Expression Simplification

Algebraic expressions can be simplified using various systematic techniques.

### Key Simplification Techniques

Essential methods for reducing expressions:

- **Combining like terms** - Group terms with same variables and exponents
- **Distributive property** - a(b + c) = ab + ac
- **Factoring** - Find common factors to simplify
- **Expanding** - Multiply out parentheses when beneficial

### Common Algebraic Identities

Useful patterns for simplification:

- **Difference of squares** - a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b)
- **Perfect square trinomials** - a² ± 2ab + b² = (a ± b)²
- **Sum/difference of cubes** - a³ ± b³ = (a ± b)(a² ∓ ab + b²)

### Example Simplifications

Practical applications with step-by-step solutions:

#### Combining Like Terms

- **Simple case:** 3x + 5x = (3 + 5)x = 8x
- **Mixed terms:** 4x² + 2x + 7x² - 3x = (4 + 7)x² + (2 - 3)x = 11x² - x
- **Multiple variables:** 2xy + 3x + 5xy - x = (2 + 5)xy + (3 - 1)x = 7xy + 2x

#### Distribution and Expansion

- **Simple distribution:** 2(x + 3) = 2x + 6
- **Negative distribution:** -3(2x - 5) = -6x + 15
- **FOIL method:** (x + 2)(x + 3) = x² + 3x + 2x + 6 = x² + 5x + 6
- **Complex expansion:** (2x - 1)(3x + 4) = 6x² + 8x - 3x - 4 = 6x² + 5x - 4

#### Factoring Applications

- **Common factor:** 6x² + 9x = 3x(2x + 3)
- **Difference of squares:** x² - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2)
- **Perfect square trinomial:** x² + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)²
- **Factoring by grouping:** x³ + 2x² + 3x + 6 = x²(x + 2) + 3(x + 2) = (x² + 3)(x + 2)

#### Complex Simplification Example

Simplify: (3x + 2)(x - 1) - 2(x² - 3x + 1)

Step 1: Expand (3x + 2)(x - 1) = 3x² - 3x + 2x - 2 = 3x² - x - 2
Step 2: Expand -2(x² - 3x + 1) = -2x² + 6x - 2
Step 3: Combine: (3x² - x - 2) + (-2x² + 6x - 2) = x² + 5x - 4
