# Copilot Instructions for Math_Foundations

## Project Architecture

This is a **Julia scientific computing project** using DrWatson for reproducibility, focused on mathematical foundations with visualization capabilities. The codebase follows a **modular mathematical library pattern** with comprehensive testing and documentation.

### Core Components

- **`src/Math_Foundations.jl`**: Main module with smart environment detection for CI/interactive plotting
- **`src/basic_maths.jl`**: Mathematical functions (roots, polynomials, hyperbolas, financial calculations)
- **`test/`**: Comprehensive test suite with CI-compatible plotting tests (54 total tests)
- **`docs/`**: Documenter.jl setup with mathematical sections (Algebra, Geometry, etc.) and cross-repository deployment to math_tech_study

## Critical Development Patterns

### Module Structure
```julia
# Main module uses @reexport for clean interface
using Reexport
@reexport using Symbolics, Nemo, Plots, Latexify, LaTeXStrings, Dates, AMRVW, Polynomials
# Comprehensive exports for all functions
export nth_root
export plot_parabola_roots_amrvw, plot_parabola_roots_polynomial, plot_parabola_roots_quadratic
# ...
```
### Environment-Aware Module Loading
```julia
# The module automatically detects CI vs interactive environments
if haskey(ENV, "CI") || get(ENV, "GKSwstype", "") == "100"
    ENV["GKSwstype"] = "100"  # Headless plotting
    gr(show=false)
end
```

## Math_Foundations CI Testing Approach

The superior CI testing strategy consists of three components:

### 1. Module-Level Headless Detection
Configure plotting environment in the main module (`Math_Foundations.jl`) at load time:
```julia
# Automatic CI detection and headless configuration
if haskey(ENV, "CI") || get(ENV, "GKSwstype", "") == "100"
    ENV["GKSwstype"] = "100"  # Force headless mode
    gr(show=false)           # Disable plot display
end
```

### 2. Manual GKS Configuration in Tests
Set `ENV["GKSwstype"] = "100"` in test files before loading the module:
```julia
# In runtests.jl - Configure headless mode before loading module
ENV["GKSwstype"] = "100"  # Force headless plotting for CI
using DrWatson, Test
@quickactivate "Math_Foundations"
using Math_Foundations
```

### 3. Separated Computational/Plotting Logic with Robust Testing
- **Pure computational functions** (`calculate_*`): Test mathematical logic directly, no try-catch
- **Plotting functions** (`plot_*`): Test with try-catch fallback for CI compatibility
- **Integration testing**: Verify both computation and visualization work together

### Test Setup (Uses @quickactivate)
```julia
# Tests use DrWatson @quickactivate pattern
using DrWatson, Test
@quickactivate "Math_Foundations"
# Load the Math_Foundations package
using Math_Foundations
```
## Plotting Functions Pattern
All plotting functions auto-save with timestamps to `plots/` directory:
```julia
savefig("plots/"* Dates.format(now(),"yyyymmdd-HHMMSS") * "functionname.png"
```

## Julia Coding Standards
### Mathematical Functions
1. Use standard Julia mathematical conventions
2. Handle negative numbers appropriately (see `nth_root`)
3. Return complex numbers for even roots of negative numbers
4. Include comprehensive edge case testing
5. Always export new functions in main module
6. Use Unicode symbols (a‚ÇÇ, a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÄ) in function parameters

### Documentation & Comments
8. Include detailed comments explaining mathematical concepts
9. Use LaTeX math notation with Latexify.jl integration
10. Ensure all examples include explanatory text
11. Maintain the notebook-based structure with markdown explanations

### Testing Patterns
12. Include unit tests for all functions
13. Use Julia's built-in testing framework
14. Use `@test` for assertions in unit tests
15. Use `@testset` to group related tests by function
16. Use `@test_throws` to test for expected errors
17. Use `@test_broken` to mark tests that are known to fail
18. Group tests with comprehensive edge cases (54+ tests)
19. **CI-Compatible Testing Pattern**: Separate computational logic from plotting, test math directly without try-catch, only use try-catch for visualization:
```julia
# Test computational logic directly (NO try-catch - mathematical errors should fail)
@testset "Pure Computational Tests" begin
    roots = calculate_parabola_roots_quadratic(1.0, 0.0, -4.0)
    @test length(roots) == 2
    @test typeof(roots) == Vector{ComplexF64}
    # Test mathematical correctness without plotting dependencies
end

# Test integration (plotting + computation) with CI-safe fallback
@testset "Integration Tests" begin
    try
        # Test the plotting function (includes computation + visualization)
        result = plot_parabola_roots_quadratic(1.0, 0.0, -4.0)
        @test typeof(result) == Vector{Float64}  # Real roots only for backward compatibility
        @test length(result) == 2
    catch e
        # Graceful fallback for CI - test function exists and computational core works
        @test hasmethod(plot_parabola_roots_quadratic, (Float64, Float64, Float64))
        # Verify computational core still works via the separate computational function
        computational_result = calculate_parabola_roots_quadratic(1.0, 0.0, -4.0)
        @test typeof(computational_result) == Vector{ComplexF64}
    end
end
```

### Code Organization
19. Follow the pattern of existing code in basic_maths.jl
20. Use consistent naming conventions for variables and functions
21. Ensure all code is well-documented and follows Julia's style guide

## Dependencies & Performance

**Heavy Dependencies** (main Project.toml): Nemo (~500MB), Makie, Symbolics, GLMakie
**Optimized Test Dependencies** (test/Project.toml): Only essential packages for CI speed

### Mathematical Libraries Used
- **Symbolics.jl**: For `@variables x` in hyperbola functions
  - Pattern: Follow the @variables pattern seen in our notebooks
  - Prefer simplify(expr, expand=true) for algebraic expressions
- **Polynomials.jl**: For polynomial root finding (`plot_parabola_roots_polynomial`)
- **AMRVW.jl**: Alternative root finding method
- **Nemo.jl**: Number theory (imported but verify usage before adding tests)
  - Use polynomial_ring(ZZ, [vars]) for creating polynomial rings
  - Prefer factor() over manual factorization

## Key Workflows

### Running Tests Locally
```bash
julia --project=. test/runtests.jl
```

### Running Tests in CI Mode
```bash
CI=true julia --project=. test/runtests.jl
```

### Building Documentation
```bash
julia --project=. docs/make.jl
```

### Julia Compilation Considerations
- **Be Patient with First Runs**: Julia often needs to precompile packages and rebuild project cache on first run. when running a Julia command in the CLI for the first time, it may take a while to precompile the packages and build the project cache, so you won't see the results of running the command for a while.
- **Typical First Run**: May take 15-30 seconds for precompilation before tests actually start
- **Example Expected Output**: `Precompiling DrWatson... 3 dependencies successfully precompiled in 17 seconds`
- **Subsequent Runs**: Much faster once cache is built
- **Don't Cancel Early**: Allow time for compilation phase to complete
- **IMPORTANT**: This applies to ALL Julia commands including CI testing with `CI=true julia --project=. test/runtests.jl`

### CI Considerations
- Plots directory must exist for plotting tests to pass
- Configure headless mode before plotting in tests
- 54 comprehensive tests covering all mathematical functions
- Test execution includes edge cases and error handling

## Git Best Practices

- **Never use `git add .`** - Always stage files explicitly by name to avoid accidentally committing development files, notebooks, or temporary files
- Use `git add <specific-file-path>` to stage only the intended files for commit
- **Feature branch naming**: Use descriptive, purpose-driven names that enable GitHub auto-suggestions:
  - ‚úÖ Good: `feature/add-fourm-site-explanation`, `fix/sidebar-center-alignment`, `docs/add-copilot-instructions`
  - ‚ùå Avoid: `feature/update-content`, `fix/stuff`, `branch1`

### Pull Request Creation
- **ALWAYS push changes first**: Use `git push origin BRANCH_NAME` before creating PR
- **Do NOT use `gh pr create`** - The GitHub CLI command doesn't work properly in this environment
- **Use GitHub web interface with URL parameters**: Create links with embedded title and description for auto-fill
- **PR Link Format with Parameters**: 
  ```
  https://github.com/FourMInfo/Math_Foundations/compare/main...BRANCH_NAME?title=Your+PR+Title&body=Your+PR+Description
  ```
- **Always provide fallback copy-paste content**: Include separate, copyable title and description in case URL parameters don't work
- **Include comprehensive descriptions**: Detail all changes, test coverage, and architectural improvements
- **Reference issue numbers**: Link to related issues when applicable

## Project-Specific Conventions

- **DrWatson Integration**: Use `projectdir()`, `srcdir()` for paths (except in tests)
- **Mathematical Notation**: Use Unicode symbols (a‚ÇÇ, a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÄ) in function parameters
- **Test Organization**: Group tests by function with comprehensive edge cases (54+ tests)
- **Documentation**: Use LaTeX math notation with Latexify.jl integration

## Function Signature Patterns

```julia
nth_root(x, n) -> Number                  # Returns complex for even roots of negative numbers
```

### Plotting Functions  
```julia
plot_parabola_roots_amrvw(a‚ÇÇ::Float64, a‚ÇÅ::Float64=0.0, a‚ÇÄ::Float64=0.0) -> Vector{ComplexF64}
plot_parabola_roots_polynomial(a‚ÇÇ::Float64, a‚ÇÅ::Float64=0.0, a‚ÇÄ::Float64=0.0) -> Vector{ComplexF64}
plot_parabola_roots_quadratic(a‚ÇÇ::Float64, a‚ÇÅ::Float64=0.0, a‚ÇÄ::Float64=0.0) -> Vector{ComplexF64}
plot_hyperbola(a::Float64=1.0, h::Float64=0.0, k::Float64=0.0) -> Plot
plot_hyperbola_axes_varx(a::Float64, b::Float64) -> Plot
plot_hyperbola_axes_direct(a::Float64, b::Float64) -> Plot
```

### Financial Functions
```julia
accrued_apr(i::Real, p::Real, c::Int64) -> Float64
accrued(i::Real, p::Real, c::Int64) -> Float64
```

### Geometric Functions
```julia
triangle_area_perim(a::Float64, b::Float64, c::Float64) -> Tuple{Float64, Float64}
```

## Documentation Patterns
- Use LaTeX for all mathematical notation
- Use LaTeX syntax for mathematical symbols not Unicode e.g. "^\circ" instead of "¬∞"
- Use Markdown for explanations
- After creating or editing a markdown document always review and fix all linting issues, unless the document is a configuration file of some kind
- Follow the pattern of existing function documentation in src directory
- When a new mathematical concept is introduced, add an external link to [MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/) for that specific concept.
  - Compare multiple potential URLs to choose the most appropriate one
  - Avoid replacing working links with inferior alternatives
  - Always use fetch_webpage function to check the link is valid and points to the correct concept.
- use underscore not askterisk for markdown emphasis  

## Communication Patterns

- Avoid being overly obsequious in responses
    - do not tell me "I am happy to help" or similar phrases
    - do not tell me how amazing I am or how great my work is

    - do not use overly emotional language
    - do not use words like "wonderful" or "great" to describe my work
    - do not use words like "perfect" or "flawless" to describe my work
- When asked to analyze a bug or problem first lay out the problem clearly, then suggest potential solutions or debugging steps and let the user decide on the next steps
- Never say "I see what the problem is" or similar phrases that imply you have fully understood the issue without further discussion and confirmation that you have understood the issue
- Always provide clear, actionable suggestions for next steps in debugging or implementation
    - Acknowledge when you need more information or clarification before proceeding
    - Summarize the current understanding of the issue before discussing potential solutions
    - Document any assumptions made during the analysis
    - Identify any knowledge gaps or areas requiring further investigation

    - Avoid unnecessary complexity in code examples
    - Use comments to explain key parts of the code where necessary
    - Ensure code examples are formatted correctly for readability
- If you find yourself repeating steps stop and explain why you are repeating them and ask if the user would like to proceed with the same steps again
- Always ask for confirmation before proceeding with potentially destructive actions, such as deleting files or making significant changes to the codebase
- When discussing code changes, clearly outline the impact of those changes on the overall project
    - Discuss how changes align with project goals and coding standards
    - Highlight any potential risks or trade-offs associated with the changes

- Always strive for clarity and precision in communication, especially when discussing technical details
- If you need to ask for clarification, do so in a way that encourages open dialogue and collaboration
    - Use open-ended questions to encourage discussion
    - Avoid leading questions that may bias the response
- When providing feedback on code or design, focus on constructive criticism that helps improve the overall quality
    - Highlight both strengths and areas for improvement
    - Provide specific examples to illustrate points
- If you encounter a situation where you need to make a judgment call, clearly outline the criteria used to make that judgment
    - Discuss any relevant factors considered in the decision-making process
